# EncryptDecrypt-Lib

This tool encrypts and decrypts the given string data by using Rijndael Algorithm. Tool uses "Symmetric Key" (password) for encryption of the plain text and decryption of the cipher text. Password can be any string and must be the same string used for encryption and decryption. Tool also uses random 17 bytes salt value along with the password to generate more complex password. Hereby, different encrypted data is produced each time for the same data and password pairs.
